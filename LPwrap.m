%
%    Error code < 0 implies an error in the first branch and there is no guarantee on

%   
%    Error code > 0 for errors in second branch and, while it may not be the minimal

%
%    The "preferred" control, up, is used to initialize the feasibility branch. The resulting error
%  components |B*up-yd| are used as slack variables to drive the solution toward yd. An upper
%  limit on the objective error components are needed to pose the problem for the bounded
%  solver, and must necessarily be emax(i) >= abs(B(i,:)*up-yd(i)) for the initial solution
%  to be feasible.Because the simplex reduces cost at each step, a sufficient condition on
% emax is emax(i) >= w'*abs(B*up-yd)/w(i);
%
%    Error code < 0 implies an error in the first branch and there is no guarantee on
%  the quality of the output solution other than the control limits and 
%     wd'*(B*u-yd) <= wd'*(B*yp-yd)
%   
%    Error code > 0 for errors in second branch and, while it may not be the minimal 
%  control error, the resulting solution should have B*u=yd and can be used.

% Notes:
%   Attainable controls may result in a small error in objective depending on

%
%   Solution with errors, errout~=0, only ensures that control limits are respected and
%  that weighted error, |B*u - yd |_1+lambda*|(u-up)|_1, is <= |B*up-yd|_1.
%
%   The "preferred" control, up, is used to initialize the optimization. The resulting error
%  components |B*up-yd| are used as slack variables to drive the solution toward yd. An upper
%  limit on the objective error components are needed to pose the problem for the bounded
%  solver, and must necessarily be emax(i) >= abs(B(i,:)*up-yd(i)) for the initial solution
%  to be feasible. Because the simplex reduces cost at each step, a sufficient condition on
% emax is emax(i) >= w'*abs(B*up-yd)/w(i);
%
%   If errout ~0 there was a problem in the solution. %
